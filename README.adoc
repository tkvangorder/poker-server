= Poker Server Overview

This is a sandbox environment for experimenting with Spring reactive programming to implement a poker server for use as a "remote" home game. Our poker group has been forced recently to move our home game online due to social distancing. There are surprisingly few choices out there to manage a private cash or tournament game. This project is an attempt to scratch that itch while giving us an excuse to study reactor and RSocket. The plan is to implement a server first and then build (or recruit someone to build) a client using something like React or Angular?

== TODO
|===
|Percent |Description
|20% |Convert imperative to reactive code. Using Reactor.
|50% |Build a domain model for a game, table, and players.
|20% |Initial RSocket connectivity
|40% |User management (Create/sign-up, update, find)
| 0% |Game creation and management 
| 0% |Secure RSocket with spring security
| 0% |Game manager functionality (pause game, add/move players, etc)
|===

== Done

- Build out a domain primitive for a deck of cards.
- Implement a poker hand ranking algorithm. Should handle Texas Hold'em to start.
- Implement a blind schedule calculator.
- Stub out a command-line RSocket client (http://github.com/tkvangorder/poker-client)
